Manipulating Files / Creating new files
Creating new files

You can create new files directly on GitHub in any repository you have write access to.

When creating a file on GitHub, consider the following:

    If you try to create a new file in a repository that you don’t have access to, we will fork the project to your user account and help you send a pull request to the original repository after you commit your change.
    File names created via the web interface can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-). To use other characters, create and commit the files locally, then push them to the repository on GitHub.

Warning: Never git add, commit, or push sensitive information to a remote repository. Sensitive information can include, but is not limited to:
hello
    Passwords
    SSH keys
    AWS access keys
    API keys
    Credit card numbers
    PIN numbers

For more information, see "Remove sensitive data."
