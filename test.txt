Manipulating Files / Creating new files
Creating new files

You can create new files directly on GitHub in any repository you have write access to.

When creating a file on GitHub, consider the following:

    If you try to create a new file in a repository that you don’t have access to, we will fork the project to your user account and help you send a pull request to the original repository after you commit your change.
    File names created via the web interface can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-). To use other characters, create and commit the files locally, then push them to the repository on GitHub.

Warning: Never git add, commit, or push sensitive information to a remote repository. Sensitive information can include, but is not limited to:

    Passwords
    SSH keys
    AWS access keys
    API keys
    Credit card numbers
    PIN numbers

For more information, see "Remove sensitive data."

    In your repository, browse to the folder where you want to create a file.
    The create new file button on GitHub Above the file list, click
